## Description

*Locations* is a list of all the specific locations where Scambi stuff happens.

<br>
<br>

## Automations

- Locations should populate a mini-map available on the website, based on [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org)
- In each page generated for every [Program] entry, the location should be a link to the map with the specific location of the current entry highlighted.
- Accessibility notes should be displayed on the website, too

<br>
<br>

Since Scambi’s philosophy chooses to use open and ethical services, the map dataset to be used is [OpenStreetMap][osm]. In order to facilitate its integration, below some useful resources:
