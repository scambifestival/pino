## Description

As [<cite lang='it'>Dissolvenze</cite>][Dissolvenze], *Newsletter* is not a database that has to be directly created or manipulated (so far). It is a list of all the people who subscribed to [Scambi Festival’s newsletter](https://epistulae.scambi.org 'Scambi Festival on Buttondown'), handled by [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email 'Buttondown official website').

The only important matter about the newsletter is [automating](#Automations) the addition of new subscribers.

#### Language

It is fundamental to remark that subscribers can be from different nationalities, and speak different languages. Therefore, the possibility of adding tags to subscribers offered by Buttondown definitely has to be exploited: people who are not Italian should be tagged as `Non-Italian`, so that they will not receive updates in Italian. At the opposite, people who are labelled as `Italian` will preferredly receive content in Italian.
